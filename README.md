SYLLABUS 
CLASS TITLE: Underwriting Intensive 
SEMESTER YEAR: FallA 2024 
COURSE NUMBER: PLANA6265
I. COURSE DESCRIPTION 
This core course examines the many aspects of underwriting income-producing real estate. Taking the risk-adverse viewpoint of the lender, students will learn to develop and piece together the complex components of an internal credit committee pro forma. Students will learn how to effectively underwrite office, retail, industrial, multifamily and hotel real estate. This class will develop students’ understanding of what lenders look for. Armed with this knowledge, students will be able to effectively communicate with lenders and achieve better terms for the kind of projects they will ultimately encounter in their careers. 
This is a half-semester core course structured as a series of lectures that focus on the specific nuances of a different asset class each week. Students will be evaluated on their homework submissions, their exams and their ability to engage in an active class discussion. Topics and dates may change as students’ progress is assessed.
II. COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND ASSIGNMENTS 
Students are expected to attend every class and complete and submit each assignment (if due) prior to the start of class. Students are expected to complete all work individually.
The homework will prepare students for an engaging discussion in which all are expected to heavily participate.
